This is a Godot 4 C# addon to import texture atlases packed by [GDX TexturePacker](https://github.com/crashinvaders/gdx-texture-packer-gui)

It will create `AtlasTexture` and `NinePatchRect` in a sub-folder, next to the atlas file, named `atlasname.atlas_textures`.

You can also choose `Sprite2D` from the drop-down and import the atlas as Sprite2D scenes into `atlasname.atlas_sprites`
